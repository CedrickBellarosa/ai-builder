# Use model to generate tags


[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Power Automate

If you want to use your trained model in Power Automate, you can find more information in [Use category classification model in Power Automate](text-classification-model-in-flow.md).

## Set run schedule on Common Data Service

Go to the **Run** view in the **Model settings** panel to set the run schedule. To configure your model to run on your database and generate predictions, select this option:

**Generate predictions when new data is added**

Your model runs once on all existing data in your text entity, and then again whenever a new record is added to that entity.

## What if the model isn't writing new tag suggestions?

- Check that you didn't exceed the number of runs for your Power Automate subscription.
- Turn off the Common Data Service run setting, and then turn it back on.
