# AI Builder in Power Apps overview

AI Builder provides two kinds of Power Apps components, depending on the models you want to use:

- Components that use prebuilt AI models that are ready to use right way:
  - [Business card reader (canvas app)](business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps.md)
  - [Business card reader (model-driven app)](business-card-reader-component-model-driven.md)
  - [Text recognizer component (canvas app)](prebuilt-text-recognizer-component-in-powerapps.md)
- Components that use custom AI models that you build and train:
  - [Form processor](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md)
  - [Object detector](object-detector-component-in-powerapps.md)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Canvas studio screen](media/canvas-studio.png "Canvas studio screen")

The canvas components are available in the canvas studio and appear in the **Insert** tab when you build your canvas app in Power Apps.
